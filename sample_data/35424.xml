    <description>Hexpack is an extrapolation of the piecepack game system, and is basically an expansion to Piecepack, adding hexagonal tiles, as the name suggests. The hexpack is a public domain game system designed to encourage creative, open game development and design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, by combining the concept of the hexpack with the concept of the SixPack set of the three red and three black piecepack suits, you end up with six suits, six sides per tile, six ranks of tile and coin, and of course, six sides on each die - as well as a six-sided SixPack suit selection die, if you like.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Home Page: &lt;a target='_blank' href="http://www.hexpack.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.hexpack.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
